  how_it_works:
    title: How it works
    content: |
      The actual game server is located on your computer.
      When you start the OwnServer Client, a dedicated secure tunnel is created between the OwnServer and your computer.
      A public address is issued exclusively for your server.
      When your friends join the game, OwnServer will forward the traffic between the public address and your computer.
      You do not need a global IP address, firewall, DDNS, port forwarding, or any other configuration to play games!
