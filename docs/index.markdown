Expose your local game server to the Internet

Project Status: Alpha release

- [English](/)

## Overview
![](/img/overview.svg)

This app creates a private tunnel between our server and your local game server. Our server forwards requests from your friends to your local server. No global IP address, firewall, DDNS, or port forwarding configuration is required!

A built-in server manager allows you to prepare game servers without struggling with terminals.
Lots of new features like save data backup are under development.
